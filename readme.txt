A temporary (preliminary) python version of specfem_sea
Last updated - Jul 5th 2022

TO DO:
    - Could do with sorting out the structure a bit.
    - Currently only working for gllx = glly = gllz
    - Check lagrange and dlagrange are correct
    - Do we need to replace GLLpx etc with zetagll, xigll etc...?
    - Are bilinear form terms correct?
